# Workout Tracker
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
For this project, I created the back end of a workout tracking application. It helps users reach their fitness goals by creating and tracking daily workouts. Here's how the application works:
1. When the page loads, the user is given the option to create a new workout or continue their last workout (if one exists). Returning users also see a summary of their last workout.
2. After choosing NEW WORKOUT or CONTINUE WORKOUT, users add exercises to their workout plan.
3. Users can view stats from the past seven workouts by clicking DASHBOARD in the top-left corner.


## Links
The application was deployed using MongoDB Atlas and Heroku.
